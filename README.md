# üóíÔ∏è Daily Planner App
This is a daily planner that llows the user to schedule their events for the day and save them to their local storage. The planner displays the current day at the top of the page and standard business hours (9AM to 5PM) in the planner. 
Each time block includes a text area for the user to enter an event, a save button to save the event to their local storage and a color code that indicates wether the hour is in the past, present or future. 

This application uses Javascript for the logic and HTML and CSS for the layout and styling. 
The Javascript code uses functions and event listeners to handle user interactions and update the content on the screen. It also uses the local storage to store the events. 

It has been created by modifying a given HTML and CSS starter code and it is the challenge for week 7 of the Front-End Development bootcamp.
